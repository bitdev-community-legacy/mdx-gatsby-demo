# Paragraph

That is a paraggraph. A paragraph (from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) παράγραφος, parágraphos, "to write beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language,paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
